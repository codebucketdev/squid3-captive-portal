Version 0.1-alpha, Work In Progress

## Introduction

Squid3 setup for restricting access by captive portal. Users are required to log in before they will be allowed to access the Internet and access local resources.

## Other Operating Systems

This setup will work for other UNIX-like systems with some slight **modifications**. As long as you can install `squid3` and a Webserver, it should work OK. The automated install is only for a clean install of a Debian based system, such as the Raspberry Pi.
